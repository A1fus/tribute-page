    <p>Pierre de Fermat was born sometime at the end of 1607. He was from Gascony, where his father, Dominique Fermat, was a wealthy leather merchant. He attended the University of Orléans from 1623 and received a bachelor in civil law in 1626, before moving to Bordeaux. He is credited with effectively invented modern number theory. Some of his many theorems include :
      <ul>
        <li> The Two Square Theorem, which shows that any prime number of the form <var>4n+1</var> can always be re-written as the sum of two square numbers.
        <li> Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for two given numbers <var>a</var> and <var>p</var> where <var>p</var> is prime and not a factor of <var>a</var>, then <var>a</var><sup> <var>p</var>-1</sup> will always leave a remainder of 1.
        <li> Fermat numbers, while not a theorem, are a subset of the integers of the form 2<sup>2<sup><var>n</var></sup></sup>+1, where <var>n</var> is a nonnegative integer. Fermat numbers are prime ∀ <var>n</var> ≤ 4, but all Fermat numbers tested after 4 have been nonprime.
      </ul>
