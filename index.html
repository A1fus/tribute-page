      <p>Pierre de Fermat was born sometime at the end of 1607. He was from Gascony, where his father, Dominique Fermat, was a wealthy leather merchant. He attended the University of Orléans from 1623 and received a bachelor in civil law in 1626, before moving to Bordeaux. He is credited with effectively invented modern number theory. Some of his many theorems include :
        <ul>
          <li> The Two Square Theorem, which shows that any prime number of the form <var>4n+1</var> can always be re-written as the sum of two square numbers.
          <li> Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for two given numbers <var>a</var> and <var>p</var> where <var>p</var> is prime and not a factor of <var>a</var>, then <var>a</var><sup> <var>p</var>-1</sup> will always leave a remainder of 1.
          <li> Fermat numbers, while not a theorem, are a subset of the integers of the form 2<sup>2<sup><var>n</var></sup></sup>+1, where <var>n</var> is a nonnegative integer. Fermat numbers are prime ∀ <var>n</var> ≤ 4, but all Fermat numbers tested after 4 have been nonprime.
        </ul>
        <blockquote>"Fermat may be regarded as
        the first inventor of differential calculus."</blockquote>
        Apart from the mathematics mentioned above, Fermat is most likely to be remembered for his so called 'Last Thereorem'. This infamous theorem, which was really a conjecture for most of it's life, states that <var>x</var><sup><var>n</var></sup>+<var>y</var><sup><var>n</var></sup>=<var>z</var><sup><var>n</var></sup> has no solutions ∀ <var>n</var> > 2. This theorem was scribbled down in the margins of Fermat's copy of <em>Arithmetica</em>, where it was famously accompanied by the statement that he knew the proof but there was just not enough space to write it down. This proof remained unsolved for over 350 years. It has seen countless attempts to solve it, but was finally solved in 1994 by Sir Andrew Wiles. It remains one of mathematics' most famous problems.
